Learn how to use MicroProfile Reactive Messaging acknowledgement strategies to acknowledge messages.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to acknowledge messages using MicroProfile Reactive Messaging acknowledgement. You'll also learn how this works with Apache Kafka. 

=== What is MicroProfile Reactive Messaging?

Temporal decoupling of services in a microservice-based architecture can be achieved using asynchronous communication. MicroProfile Reactive Messaging provides a way to build systems of microservices advocating responsiveness, location transparency, elasticity, resiliency to failure and temporal decoupling. This helps in enforcing asynchronous message passing between the different parts of the system. See
https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_microprofile_reactive_messaging[ MicroProfile Reactive Messaging Specification^] for more information.

To learn more about the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging, read https://draft-guides.mybluemix.net/guides/microprofile-reactive-messaging.html[Creating asynchronous reactive microservices using MicroProfile Reactive Messaging].

=== What is MicroProfile Reactive Messaging acknowledgement?

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging Acknowledgement ensures that in case of any system failure, no messages are lost. Messaging system like Apache Kafka differentiates between when a message is being delivered to a system and the processing of that message by that system being complete. If the system goes down, any messages which have been sent but not processed completely can then be sent again. Reactive messaging applications implement this using message acknowledgements.

The OpenLiberty Cafe application that you'll be working with consists of six microservices : `Bar`, `Kitchen`, `Order`, `OpenLibertyCafe`, `ServingWindow`, and `Status`. It also uses Kafka to enable reactive messaging communication between the Producer and Consumer microservices over the messaging channels.

You'll update the `Bar`, `Kitchen`, and `Status` microservices to use MicroProfile Reactive Messaging acknowledgement strategies for message acknowledgement. These microservices run on Open Liberty.

The `OpenLibertyCafe` microservice is a https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html#variation-backends-for-frontends[backend for frontend^] service.
It communicates with the backend microservices on the caller's behalf.

The waitstaff places a request using the `OpenLibertyCafe` microservice.

The `Order` microservice consumes the request, produces order messages, and sends them to Kafka on the `food` or `beverage` channel depending on the type. 

An order begins with a `NEW` status. The `Bar` and `Kitchen` microservices illustrate how to handle the orders as a real cafe. They consume and process the order and update the status to `IN_PROGRESS` and `READY` consecutively. There’s a sleep operation in between each status to represent the order processing time, and the status updates are reported back to the `Status` microservice via reactive messages on the Kafka.

The `ServingWindow` microservice illustrates when the food and beverages are ready to be served. It consumes the `READY` order from the `Kitchen` and `Bar` microservices. Once the order is served, the waitstaff can mark the order as `COMPLETED` and the status is sent back to the `Status` microservice as a message.

The `Status` microservice receives status updates and provides queries for the waitstaff. All the orders are persisted here. Because persisting data is not the focus of this guide, the `Status` microservice simply uses a Map object to store the data.

== MicroProfile Reactive Messaging Acknowledgement Strategies

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging acknowledgement consists of mainly four strategies namely `NONE`, `PRE_PROCESSING` , `POST_PROCESSING` and `MANUAL`.
Acknowledgement is an important part of message processing. Messages are either acknowledged explicitly, or implicitly by the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging implementation.

`@Acknowledgement` for the `@Incoming` messages is controlled by the `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Acknowledgment` annotation.
Default acknowledgement depends on the method signature. Each method signature implements different acknowledgement policies. If the Acknowledgment annotation is not set, the default policy is applied.

Different defaults and supported acknowledgement for each supported signature could be found at the https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_message_acknowledgement[Messaging acknowledgement^] table of the specification.

Methods annotated with only `@Outgoing` do not support acknowledgement as they don’t receive any incoming `Message`.

=== MicroProfile Reactive Messaging NONE Acknowledgement strategy

If the acknowledgement strategy is set to `NONE`, no acknowledgment will be performed. The `NONE` strategy indicates that the incoming message is not acknowledged and the acknowledgment of the outgoing message would not acknowledge the incoming message anymore. The `NONE` strategy may be used for the protocols that do not support message acknowledgment.

=== Building the Bar microservice with PRE_PROCESSING Acknowledgement strategy

If the acknowledgement strategy is set to `PRE_PROCESSING`, the Reactive Messaging implementation acknowledges the message before the annotated method or processing is executed.

If an `@Incoming` annotated method has an acknowledgement strategy defined as `@Acknowledgment(Acknowledgment.Strategy.PRE_PROCESSING)`, the Reactive Messaging implementation is responsible for the acknowledgement of the message.

//Bar
[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `BarService` class.#
`bar/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/bar/BarService.java`
----
BarService.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/bar/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/bar/BarService.java[]
----

If the order is an item of drink, `Bar` service receives an order on the [hotspot=bevOrderConsume file=0]`@Incoming("beverageOrderConsume")` channel, processes it in [hotspot=initBevOrder file=0]`receiveBeverageOrder()` method and sends back an `IN_PROGRESS` status on the [hotspot=bevOrderPublishInter file=0]`@Outgoing("beverageOrderPublishStatus")` channel to Kafka over MicroProfile Reactive Messaging channels. After a while, a `READY` status will be sent to the [hotspot=bevOrder file=0]`@Outgoing("beverageOrderPublishStatus")` channel.

The [hotspot=initBevOrder file=0]`receiveBeverageOrder()` method in Bar microservice matches the following signature.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
@Incoming("in")
@Outgoing("out")
O method(I payload)
----

Based on the table mentioned in the https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_message_acknowledgement[specification^] , the default acknowledgement strategy would be `POST_PROCESSING`. It means that the messages will be acknowledged when the annotated method executes completely. However when we change the strategy to [hotspot=ackPreProcessing file=0]`PRE_PROCESSING`, the incoming message will be acknowledged even before the annotated method is called. It also means that the acknowledgment of the outgoing message would not acknowledge the incoming message anymore, as it’s already acknowledged. In case the service goes down when the message is being processed, the Kafka won't resend the message if the service is restored as the Kafka already processed the message.

=== Building the Kitchen microservice with POST_PROCESSING Acknowledgement strategy

If the acknowledgement strategy is set to `POST_PROCESSING`, the Reactive Messaging implementation acknowledges the message after the annotated method or processing is executed. When dealing with payloads, the `POST_PROCESSING` strategy is the default strategy. 

If an `@Incoming` annotated method has an acknowledgement strategy defined as `@Acknowledgment(Acknowledgment.Strategy.POST_PROCESSING)`, the Reactive Messaging implementation is responsible for the acknowledgement of the message.

//Kitchen
[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]

[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/kitchen/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/kitchen/KitchenService.java[]
----

If the order is an item of food, `Kitchen` service receives an order on the [hotspot=foodOrderConsume file=0]`@Incoming("foodOrderConsume")` channel, processes it in [hotspot=initFoodOrder file=0]`receiveFoodOrder()` method and sends back an `IN_PROGRESS` status on the [hotspot=foodOrderPublishIntermediate file=0]`@Outgoing("foodOrderPublishStatus")` channel to Kafka over MicroProfile Reactive Messaging channels. After a while, a `READY` status will be sent to the [hotspot=foodOrder file=0]`@Outgoing("foodOrderPublishStatus")` channel.

The [hotspot=initFoodOrder file=0]`receiveFoodOrder()` method in Kitchen microservice annotated with [hotspot=ackPostProcessing file=0]`POST_PROCESSING` acknowledgement strategy indicates that the incoming message is acknowledged when the outgoing message is acknowledged. i.e. when the emitted data is acknowledged. In case the service goes down when the message is being processed, the Kafka will resend the message and the message will be reprocessed.

Check the https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-reactive-messaging-1.0/microprofile-reactive-messaging-spec.html#_message_acknowledgement[specification^] to see whether reactive messaging does `PRE_PROCESSING` or `POST_PROCESSING` message acknowledgements for your method. If it does `PRE_PROCESSING` consider changing to `POST_PROCESSING` based on your application need.

=== Building the Status microservice with MANUAL Acknowledgement strategy

If the acknowledgement strategy is set to `MANUAL`, a user or a developer is responsible for the acknowledgement. It can be achieved by calling the `Message.ack()` method, so that the Reactive Messaging implementation does not apply implicit acknowledgement.

//status
[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Replace the `StatusResource` class.#
`status/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/status/StatusResource.java`
----

StatusResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/status/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/status/StatusResource.java[]
----

status/microprofile-config.properties
[source, Text, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/status/src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----

The `Status` microservice receives the message from the `Bar`, `Kitchen`, `Order`, and `ServingWindow` microservices over the [hotspot=updateStatus file=0]`@Incoming("updateStatus")` channel with its properties defined in the [hotspot=updateStatus file=1]`microprofile-config.properties`.

The [hotspot=updateStatusMethod file=0]`updateStatus()` method in Status microservice annotated with [hotspot=ackManual file=0]`MANUAL` acknowledgement strategy 
indicates that the incoming message acknowledgement is managed by the user code. The [hotspot=manualAckUser file=0]`order.ack()` method acknowledges the message once the method completes all it's processing.

For the `MANUAL` acknowledgement, transiting data needs to be wrapped in a `Message`. The `Message` class provides metadata and also allows messages to be acknowledged.

== Building the application

You will build and run the `Bar`, `Kitchen`, `Order`, `OpenLibertyCafe`, `ServingWindow`, and `Status` microservices in Docker containers.

Start your Docker environment.

To build the application, run the Maven `install` and `package` goals from the command line in the `start` directory:

[role='command']
```
mvn -pl models install
mvn package
```

Run the following command to download or update the `open-liberty` docker image to latest.
[role='command']
```
docker pull open-liberty
```

Run the following commands to containerize the microservices:

[role='command']
```
docker build -t bar:1.0-SNAPSHOT bar/.
docker build -t kitchen:1.0-SNAPSHOT kitchen/.
docker build -t openlibertycafe:1.0-SNAPSHOT openLibertyCafe/.
docker build -t order:1.0-SNAPSHOT order/.
docker build -t servingwindow:1.0-SNAPSHOT servingWindow/.
docker build -t status:1.0-SNAPSHOT status/.
```

Next, use the provided script to start the application in Docker containers. The script creates a network for the containers to communicate with each other. It also creates containers for Kafka, Zookeeper, and all of the microservices in the project.

== Trying the application

Once the application is up and running, you can access the application by making requests to the `OpenLibertyCafe` endpoint using OpenAPI.

The services take some time to become available. Check out the service that you created at the
http://localhost:9080/openapi/ui[^] URL.

*Place Orders*

Make a `POST` request to the `/api/orders` endpoint. To make this request, expand the `POST` endpoint on the UI, click the *Try it out button*. Copy the following example input into the text box, and then click the `Execute` button. The `POST` request adds a new `food` and `beverage` Order.

[source, role='command']
----
{
  "tableId": "1",
  "foodList": [
    "burger"
  ],
  "beverageList": [
    "coke"
  ]
}
----

*Check IN_PROGRESS Order Status*

Next, make a `GET` request to the `/api/status` endpoint. To make this request, expand the `GET` endpoint on the UI, click the *Try it out button*, and then click the `Execute` button. The `GET` request returns information about the Orders. The response should show that the Orders have an `IN_PROGRESS` status. Just in case if you see a `NEW` status then wait for a couple of seconds and click the `Execute` button again.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
[
  {
    "item": "burger",
    "orderId": "0001",
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
    "tableId": "1",
    "type": "FOOD"
  },
  {
    "item": "coke",
    "orderId": "0002",
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
    "tableId": "1",
    "type": "BEVERAGE"
  }
]
----

*Check READY Order Status*

Click `Execute` again and you will see the response with a `READY` status. Just in case if you see an `IN_PROGRESS` status then wait for a couple of seconds and click the `Execute` button again.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
[
  {
    "item": "burger",
    "orderId": "0001",
    "status": "READY",
    "tableId": "1",
    "type": "FOOD"
  },
  {
    "item": "coke",
    "orderId": "0002",
    "status": "READY",
    "tableId": "1",
    "type": "BEVERAGE"
  }
]
----

*Complete an Order*

Make a `POST` request to the `/api/servingWindow/{orderId}` endpoint to complete an order. Expand the `POST` endpoint on the UI, click the *Try it out* button. Copy the following orderId into the text box, and then click the `Execute` button.
 
[source, role='command']
----

0002
----

The status for the `orderId 0002` is changed from `READY` to `COMPLETED` and the updated status is cascaded to the `Status` microservice.

Then, make a `GET` request to the `/api/status` endpoint again and verify that the status for the order with an `orderId` of `0002` is now labelled as `COMPLETED`.

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
[
  {
    "item": "burger",
    "orderId": "0001",
    "status": "READY",
    "tableId": "1",
    "type": "FOOD"
  },
  {
    "item": "coke",
    "orderId": "0002",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "tableId": "1",
    "type": "BEVERAGE"
  }
]
----

== Tearing down the environment

Finally, use the following script to stop the application:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
./scripts/stopContainers.sh
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
.\scripts\stopContainers.bat
```
--
